Docco is a quick-and-dirty, hundred-line-long, literate-programming-style
documentation generator. For more information, see:

http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/

This fork of docco is meant to make docco more usable for large projects with a nested directory structure

By using a node server, requests for documentation pages will use docco to generate the documentation for each request,
so you don't have to recompile the docs each time you change a file.
